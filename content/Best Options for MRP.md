## QuickBooks Time
- Obviously has great QuickBooks integration
- Employees can clock in and out from an app
	- Not sure if we can keep them from logging in on a phone, but geofencing can solve that issue either way
- Allows for estimated vs actual hour tracking
- Can track notes and photos
- Can add billable time directly to invoices for rush jobs and overages
- Cannot track consumable use - maybe we can manage that through notes? Or continue using manual checks for stock level? Do we need another tool for this?
- No real project scheduling capabilities
- May need to do per task efficiency reporting on another platform

On the whole it looks like this will work well, with a couple shortcomings.
### Pricing
- $130 + $11 per seat/mo. (~$350/mo.)
